# LLM Web Application - Make Friends with English

## Project Description
This project is to develop a web application tailored to English learners from Japanese or Mandarin-speaking backgrounds. The app is able to identify errors in sentences written by learners and suggest accurate corrections, ultimately enhancing their learning experience and improving their language proficiency. The **Methods & Techniques** section below illustrates the implementation details for an end-to-end NLP pipeline. 

## ü§ù Team Members
Our team is named A Very Beta ChatGPT 4.5 and made up of the following members:
- Stefan Hall
- Tim Wang

## üñ• Deployment
To run the application locally, navigate to the 'Model Deployment' folder and execute the code below in your terminal:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `streamlit run app.py`

To enable the public access, the web application was deployed on Hugging Face Space. Find web app [**here**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/amyyang/webapp_englishtool). You can also find the [fine-tuned models](https://huggingface.co/amyyang) on Hugging Face.

### The web application layout

You can make selection for your native language and the language model to be used. 
- Your native language Japanese or Madarin. (For this project, only two foreign language backgrounds are considered.)
- Language model to use BART or GPT-2. 

Once the options above are selected, you can enter the sentence and click 'Generate' button to get the recommended/corrected sentence as well as the POS tagging and Dependency Tree to visualise the relationships between words in a sentence. &nbsp;  &nbsp;

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Data Source
The dataset used in this project is from [NAIST Lang-8 Learner Corpora](https://sites.google.com/site/naistlang8corpora/home?authuser=0). The python file `extract_err-cor-pair_new.py` in the repository is used for data extraction into csv files. It is a modified version of [this](https://github.com/tomo-wb/Lang8-NAIST-extractor/blob/master/scripts/extract_err-cor-pair.py) original file.
